METRIC 1: In order to gauge user happiness using rating and NPS we would include a pop up window within our app that that asked the user "How likely are you recommend our app to a friend?" or "How would you rate your ROOMIE experiance?". Each question could be answered with a rating from 1 - 5. These question could also be included in future user research surveys if we choose to release a beta version to a small testing population.

METRIC 2: Number of households being created - We can collect this data using the Google Cloud console in order to track the usage of our Cloud Functions (such as the generateCode function in order to generate a new household)
