## Business Plan Explanation
The Lean Canvas business model serves as the backbone for our project, enabling us to simplify our business concept into essential components for strategic planning and execution. By leveraging this approach, we aim to streamline our path by clearly defining our target audience, unique value proposition, distribution channels, revenue streams, and cost structure. Through the Lean Canvas, we can optimize our business model for maximum efficiency and impact.
