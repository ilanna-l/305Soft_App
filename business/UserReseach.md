    - Team Action (if any): Considering how people view the effort required for different chores we can take that into consideration when deciding how chores will be randomly assigned as to not give the same person a high effort chore multiple times in a row.

    - Supporting Data: 32/49 total responses to the question "What don't you like about living with roommates?" mentioned one point about cleanliness or uneven chore splitting between roommates. 
    - Team Action (if any): We can prioritize cleaning chores for users, and evenly distribute these chores among roommates so that each individial has incentive to clean at least once, rather than one person doing all of the work. This is also a way to ensure that the chore gets done.
